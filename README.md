picking-up-nodestack
====================

# Overview

This started as a presentation for some colleagues on moving forward
with a new web development stack. My goal was to give them a quick
hands on tutorial that would leave them with a working copy of NodeJS
on their laptops to play with. I realized I had enough material to 
do more than that so that is what started picking-up-nodestack.


* Talk 01
	+ Install NodeJS on a Macbook
	+ Write a simple program
	+ Use a module
	+ Write a simple web server
* Talk 02
	+ Introduce YUI3
	+ Introduce io-base
	+ Introduct handlebars
	+ Write a simple web server side mashup
