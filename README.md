# Overview

On Feb 12, 2013 I am scheduled to give a presentation at work.  I'm picking
a quick, hands on tutorial of NodeJS to show half the stack we'll be migrating
to for new projects that need to scale where LAMP is a poor fit.

I probably have enough material for two talks.  Will split this as a part 1,
part 2 presentation.

* Part 1: Introduce NodeJS, get it setup, write a simple program, use a module, write a simple web server
* Part 2: Introduce YUI3 Server side (e.g. io-base, handlebars), evolve simple web server into a new services
